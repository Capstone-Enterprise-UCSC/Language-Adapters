What we see today in certain Islamic countries is the presence of the people on the scene.,"Abin da a yau yake faruwa a wasu kasashen musulmi, fitowar al'ummomi da kasantuwarsu a fagen gwagwarmaya ne."
"[The Holy Quran, 48: 29] These are the developmental stages of the Islamic Ummah.","Wannan shi ne matakai na ci gaban al'ummar musulmi; suna girmama da samun daukaka, da kuma karfafa."
"At Soleiman Khan and Nawwab religious schools and under the supervision of his father and the tutorships of some great religious scholars, he studied all the 'intermediate level ' curriculum including logic, philosophy and Islamic jurisprudence in the exceptionally short time of five years.","A daidai wannan lokacin ne kuma ya karanci littafin ‘Mu’alim’.

"One time an incompetent person like Shah Sultan Hussein caused the Iranian nation to retreat into a corner, but another time a courageous person like Nader Gholi - without those honorary titles - emerged among the people and became their leader by relying on his courage and as a result, our nation managed to expand the arena of its glory from Delhi to the Black Sea.","Imam ya yi amanna da hakan.

"Subsequent elections were held to approve of the newly-drafted Constitution. Along with the position of the Grand Leader, the constitution also requires that a president be elected every four years, but only those candidates approved indirectly by the Council of Guardians may run for the office. Imam Khomeini himself became instituted as the Grand Leader for life, and officially decreed as the ""Leader of the Revolution.""","A ci gaba da ayyukansa na kiyayya da Musulunci, a watan Esfand 1354 (Fabrairun 1975), Shah ya canza kalandar (kwanakin wata) da hukuma take amfani da ita da ta fara daga hijiran Ma'aikin Allah (s.a.w.a) ya zuwa farkon mulkin mulukiyya Hakhamanshiyyawa.

The existence of sincere and friendly officials is indeed one of the greatest divine blessings for the Armed Forces in this era. One must consider this a truly great blessing and thank God for it.,"Alal hakika daya daga cikin manyan ni'imomin Ubangiji a wannan lokacin ga dakarunmu masu makami, ita ce samuwar jami'ai masu gaskiya da kuma kokari; wannan lamari ne da ke sanya mutum ya girmama irin wannan ni'ima mai girma sannan kuma ya gode."

"He acted, worked and spoke for the sake of God and he knew that ""if you help (the cause of) Allah, He will help you"" [The Holy Quran, 47: 7] is a divine promise and that it is definite and inviolable.","Ya yunkura ne saboda Allah, ya yi magana da kuma aiki a kas yana da yakinin cewa: ""Idan kun taimaki Allah, zai taimake ku"" (Suratu Muhammad 47:7), wannan dai alkawari ne na Ubangiji, wanda tabbas ne zai cika shi, babu wani kokwanto cikin hakan."
"The vigilant eyes of the youth, intellectuals and religious scholars should be very watchful.",Lalle wajibi ne farkakkun idanuwan matasa da masana da malaman addini su zamanto masu lura ainun.
"His Eminence stressed the necessity of pursuing projects and tasks until the desired results are produced, saying: “Leaving tasks unfinished will raise certain questions and it will be problematic. Unfortunately in the present time, this situation is witnessed in some areas of the country, an example of which is the issue of the extraordinary high salaries.","A ci gaba da jawabin nasa Jagoran ya jaddada wajibci ci gaba da gudanar da ayyukan da aka sa a gaba har sai an kai ga manufar da aka sa a gaba yana mai cewa: Barin aiki ba tare da an gama ba, hakan yana sanya alamun tambaya, koda yake abin bakin cikin shi ne cewa har ya zuwa yanzu ana samu hakan na faruwa a wasu bangarori na kasar, wanda daga cikinsu kuwa abin bakin cikin shi ne irin albashi na fitar hankali da wasu jami'ai suka sanya wa kansu."
"The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that the responsibilities have been clearly specified in the Constitution. He added that the Leader does not want to interfere in the decisions and actions of the administration, but that he will intervene whenever he feels an important national interest has been ignored. Ayatollah Khamenei stressed: ""Regarding the recent event, which is not very important, I felt that an important interest has been ignored.""","Har ila yau yayin da ya ke ishara da yadda kundin tsarin mulki ya tsara wa kowa aiki da nauyin da ke wuyansa, Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci ya bayyana cewar: Jagora dai ba shi da niyyar tsoma baki cikin ayyukan gwamnati, face dai a wajen da ya fahimci cewa an gafala daga maslaha (ta kasa).

"They pray, they engage in dhikr and they go to holy places. Even those who travel to another city - in which there are no famous holy places - spend the first hours of the New Year at the shrine of a descendant of an infallible Imam if they find one.","Abin farin cikin shi ne cewa al'ummar mu suna lura, suna karanta addu'oi, suna ambaton Allah, suna halartar wajaje masu tsarki na addini; hatta mutanen da suke tafiya garuruwan da a zahiri ba su da fitattun wajaje masu tsarki, to amma idan har aka gano wani hubbare na 'ya'yan Imamai, to su kan tafi wannan wajen don gudanar da lokacin da sabuwar shekara take shigowa a wajen."

"And I ask God to bestow His peace and blessings on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.), on his household and on the Imam of the Age (God’s greetings be upon him and may our souls be sacrificed for his sake).","Ina sake mika gaisuwa ta da kuma taya murna ga al'ummarmu masu girma, sannan kuma ina rokon Allah Madaukakin Sarki da yayi salati da tabbatar da aminci ga Annabi Muhammadu da Alayen Muhammadu haka nan kuma ga mai girma Baqiyatullah (Imam Mahdi), rayukanmu su zamanto fansa a gare shi."
"If we find an army in the world whose beliefs and feelings are the same as those of the people, an army which is truly at the service of the people and national interests rather than at the service of certain individuals, that army is a very valuable army.","Idan har muka sami wasu sojoji a duniya da akidarsu tamkar akidar jama'a ce, abin da suke ji tamkar abin da mutane suke ji ne, sannan kuma ba sa ganin kansu a matsayin masu hidima ga daidaikun mutane face dai a matsayin masu hidima ga dukkanin mutane da kuma manufa ta kasa da dukkanin ma'anarta ta hakika; to kuwa wadannan sojojin suna da kimar gaske."

"The Islamic Ummah can be free, advanced, knowledgeable, glorious and powerful. These things are achievable thanks to Islamic teachings.","Al'ummar musulmi, albarkacin koyarwar Musulunci, tana iya samun 'yanci, tana iya samun ci gaba, tana iya samun ilimi, tana iya zama madaukakiya sannan da kuma zama mai karfi."
This is one of the things that has been done since the beginning of the Revolution.,Wannan shi ne daya daga cikin ayyukan da suka aikata tun farko nasarar wannan juyi na Musulunci ya zuwa yau din nan.
We want them to feel that they can be independent of the arrogant powers of the world and that they can build Armed Forces that are equipped with the products of indigenous ideas and innovations.

"Because I do not want to mention names, I will just continue without mentioning any names. In the years 1358 and 1359, both the people of Qom and the people of Tabriz gave rise to an epic.","A wannan shekarar ta 1358 da 1359 (1979 da 1980) mutanen Kum da mutanen Tabriz sun samar da wani irin yunkuri; ba wai kawai yunkuri na shigowa fage da kunce kulli ba, face ma dai da kumaji da yunkuri irin na ruhi da kyakkyawar fahimta."
The organizations in charge in all the three government branches must seriously oppose these enemies of security and unity of the country and penalize those who are behind these fitnas.,Wajibi ne ga dukkan cibiyoyi da jami'an gwamnati acikin kowane bangare uku na iko su yi aiki da nauyin da ya rataya a wuyansu wajen fuskantar masu adawa da tsaro da kuma hadin kan kasa su kuma hukunta masu haddasa fitina.
"His Eminence emphatically called on teachers to develop faith in the importance of their role and added: ""It is essential to plan fundamental changes in the education system, and this must be carried out considering the needs, lofty ideals, and human capacities of the country.

"Today this is a precious experience that is available to the peoples who have stood up against arrogance and tyranny and have managed to overthrow and shake corrupt governments that are subservient to and dependent on America. Resistance, patience, insight and faith in the divine promise ""surely Allah will help him who helps His cause"" will pave this path of glory for the Islamic Ummah until it reaches the peak of Islamic civilization.","A yau dai wannan gagarumar kwarewar tana hannun wadannan al'ummomi wadanda suka yi tsayin daka a gaban ma'abota girman kai da 'yan mulkin mallaka, sannan kuma suka sami nasarar kawar da lalatattun hukumomi da 'yan amshin shatan Amurka ko kuma girgiza su.

"These three beliefs were exhibited in the events that happened during Bahman of 1357, in the fitnas that happened in the country, in the establishment of the Islamic Republic, in his open resistance against the oppressive global order, in the slogan of ""neither the East, nor the West"", in the imposed war and in all the events that took place in those eventful ten years of Imam's life.","A lamarin da ya faru a watan Bahman na 1357 (lokacin nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci), a lokacin fitinun cikin gida, a lokacin sanar da tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci, a tsayin dakan da ya yi wajen tinkarar azzaluman gwamnatocin duniya, a lokacin sanar da taken ‘Ba Gabashi ba, Ba Kuma Yammaci Ba', a lokacin kallafaffen yaki, cikin dukkanin lamurran da suka faru tsawon wadannan shekaru 10 na rayuwar Imam, dukkanin wadannan imani guda uku sun bayyanar da kansu a tattare da Imam."

"In these countries, the movements were anti-America and anti-Zionism, but America is clearly involved in Syria.

"During his visit, Ayatollah Khamenei spoke to various publishers who had participated in the book fair and closely inspected publication issues as well as the latest publications on different fields.",Kamar yadda kuma ya yi kiran da a gudanar da bincike na ilimi a duk lokacin da aka gudanar da irin wannan kasuwar baje kolin littafin don ganin shin an samu ci gaba ne a fagen irin abubuwan da littafan suka kumsa ko kuma a'a.
"His Eminence stressed that the Islamic Republic of Iran supports the unity and independence of Lebanon.

A young man or lady will come and criticize you.,"A halin yanzu kuna sukan cewa me ya sa wani tsoho yake shugabanci, mai ba shi shawara kuma matashi."
The victory of the Islamic Revolution and the greatness of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) shook the west and the arrogant powers.,"Nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci da kuma girmar Imam, sun girgiza kasashen yammaci, sun girgiza tsarin mulkin mallaka."
I would like to take this opportunity to mention a point. Your province is inhabited by both Shia and Sunni Muslims.,"A nan ina son in sanar da ku cewa, lardin ku, lardi ne da 'yan Shi'a da Sunna suke rayuwa tare da junansu."
Fortunately the people and the government truly showed intensified effort and labor throughout the year.,"Lalle mu din nan a fagagen tattalin arziki, a fagen siyasa, a fagen shigowar mutane fage daban-daban na siyasa da juyin juya hali, a fagen ilimi da fasaha da fagen siyasar waje, a bangarori daban-daban, lalle mun shaidi faruwar manyan ayyukan da jami'an gwamnati, bangaren gudanarwa ne, ko bangaren majalisar da ma'aikatar shari'a, lalle sun aikata manyan ayyuka; musamman ma bangaren gudanarwa na gwamnati (shugaban kasa da 'yan majalisar ministoci) wanda ta gudanar da ayyuka masu girman gaske tsawon wannan shekarar wanda daya daga cikinsu shi ne wannan lamari na mai girma da wahala na manufantar da irin rangwamin da gwamnati take bayarwa kayayyakin bukatun yau da kullum, wanda sun fara wannan aiki mai girma."
"Elsewhere in his speech, the Leader of Islamic Revolution referred to the current regional developments and added: ""Thanks to Islam and the Islamic Revolution, today Islamic Awakening has already taken place in the region, and this movement will definitely produce results, just as it has in certain parts of the region.""","A wani bangare na jawabin nasa kuwa, yayin da yake ishara da lamurran da suke faruwa a wannan yankin na irin sauye-sauyen da ake samu kuwa, Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci ya bayyana cewar: A yau dai albarkacin Musulunci da juyin juya halin Musulunci, ana iya ganin irin yadda farkawa da kuma wayewa ta Musulunci ta mamaye dukkanin wannan yankin, wanda kuma ko shakka babu za ta kai ga gaci, kamar yadda ya zuwa yanzu ta gai ga gacin a wasu kasashen."

The first strength of the Islamic Republic is that it has proven its capabilities are superior to the threats. This is a very important point.,"Batu na farko daga cikin abubuwa masu kyau da kuma irin karfi na wannan tsarin wanda kuma tsarin ya tabbatar da shi, shi ne nasara da yin galaba a kan barazana daban-daban da aka yi (wa tsarin); wannan lamari ne mai muhimmancin gaske."

It is possible to carry out research on the basis of such research or add new things to it in order to improve or even reject it.,"A matsayin misali mai yiyuwa ne a duniya ya zamana an gudanar da wani bincike na ilimi a wani wasan, to amma bai kamata a tsaya a wajen ba, a ci gaba da gudanar da ayyuka bisa hakan har a kai ga gaci."
"We had to prepare it for our research reactor in Tehran, which has been built to produce radiopharmaceuticals: we had run out of 20-percent enriched uranium.","Ya zama wajibi mu samar da makamashi (wato tacaccen uranium kashi ashirin cikin dari) ga cibiyar bincikenmu ta Tehran, saboda kuwa makashin da ake da shi din ya kusan karewa."

The fifth point is that one of the standards for judging whether Islamic Awakening movements are on the right path is the positions they adopt on the issue of Palestine.,Batu na biyar shi ne cewa daya daga cikin hanyoyin tabbatar da cewa yunkurin farkawa ta Musulunci yana kan tafarki madaidaici (ko a'a) shi ne cewa wajibi ne a lura da matsaya da mahangar wannan yunkurin kan batun Palastinu.
Is the presence of millions of enthusiastic and insightful people in the ceremonies marking the 31st anniversary of the Revolution not enough to awaken the ill-wishers and deceived people inside the country who sometimes hypocritically claim to support the people? Is this not enough to show them the wish and path of the nation which is the path of pure Islam and our magnanimous Imam?,"Ashe fitowar miliyoyin mutane ma'abota basira da kumaji a yayin bukin tunawa da shekaru talatin da daya na nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci bai isa masu kiyayya (da tsarin Musulunci) da kuma wadanda aka yaudara na cikin gida wadanda a wasu lokuta cikin riya suke magana dangane da 'al'umma' su dawo cikin hayacinsu da kuma nuna masu hanya da kuma bukatar mutane wadda ita ce dai wannan madaidaicin tafarki na tsarkakakken Musulunci na Annabi Muhammadu, tsira da amincin Allah su tabbata a gare shi da Alayensa da kuma tafarkin Imam (Khumaini) mai girma ba?"
"Some people spin negative yarns when there is a mention of the Sacred Defense, make sarcastic comments when there is a mention of martyrdom, distort their faces when there is a mention of disabled soldiers and war veterans and laugh scornfully when there is a mention of centrifuges for uranium enrichment. They simply shake their heads and say, ""It is impossible."" These people do not understand anything about the movement of a nation.","Mutanen da a lokacin da aka yi magana kan kallafaffen yaki suke wa lamarin kallo mara kyau, a lokacin da aka yi magana kan shahada sai su kama suka; a lokacin da aka yi magana kan wadanda suka sami rauni a wajen yaki da wadanda suka yi sadaukarwa, sai su turbune fuskokinsu, a lokacin da aka yi magana kan ci gaban ilimi da karya kan iyakar ilimi da aka yi, sai su dinga dariya ta isgili, a lokacin da aka yi maganar makwararan makamashin nukiliya, sai su dinga karkada kawukansu suna cewa haka ba abu ne mai yiyuwa ba, to lalle wadannan mutane ba su fahimci yunkurin wata al'umma ba."

"And give good news to the humble."" [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 34] On the other hand, it represents the ayah ""... the Sacred Mosque, which We have made equally for all men, (for) the dweller therein and the visitor.""","Kuma ka yi bushara ga masu kankantar da kai ne, a wani bangaren kuma (daidai ya ke da fadin Allah Madaukakin Sarki cewa): ""Da masallaci mai alfarma wanda Muka sanya shi ga mutane alhali kuwa mazauni a ciki da bakauye daidai suke""."

"If we Muslims could present Islam appropriately and if we could adjust our behavior according to Islam, the entire world would definitely turn to Islam. The problem is with us.","Matukar dai mu din nan musulmi muka iya gabatar da Musulunci ga al'ummomin duniya yadda ya ke, matukar muka iya sanya rayuwar mu ta yi daidai da koyarwar Musulunci, to ko shakka babu al'ummomin duniya za su rungumi Musulunci."
This is an important point.,Wannan shi ne abin da Musulunci yake so.
The first point that I would like to discuss is related to the issue of elections.,"Abubuwan da nake son fadi, suna da alaka ne da wannan batu na zabe."
"You convey messages that cannot be conveyed by any other means. You convey the message of determination, resistance and faith. When our athletes achieve a victory in such arenas and when they are ranked first, they chant the slogan of ""Ya Hussein"", prostrate themselves and hold up their hands and thank God.","Kuna isar da wani sako ne, wato sako na azama da irada, sako na tsayin daka da imani, wannan babu wata hanyar da za a iya isar da shi (in ba ta wannan hanyar ba).

"Materialistic powers have to deal with the problem that their soldiers are a nervous wreck in different parts of the world, but the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran enjoy the advantage that their members enter the arena motivated by religious faith.","Idan har manyan kasashe masu karfi na duniya sun baza sojojinsu a yankuna daban-daban na duniya, to amma dakarun Jamhuriyar Musulunci kan suna da wannan siffa ta cewa su din nan suna kasancewa ne a fage cikin kumaji da imani (ba tare da an tilasta musu ba)."

"For several centuries, the great Islamic Ummah, which has been in one of the most strategic locations in the world, was suffering from weakness, defeat, backwardness, colonialism and material and scientific poverty due to the interference of superpowers, greed of powerful governments and belligerence of the arrogant powers. The attention of the Islamic Revolution was focused on the world of Islam. Its attention was focused on helping the Islamic Ummah get rid of the arrogant powers' hand of oppression and aggression.","Al'ummar musulmi wadanda suke a wani waje mafi muhimmanci na duniya, tana fuskantar matsalar rauni, koma baya, mulkin mallaka, talauci - talauci na abin duniya da kuma rashi na ilimi - sakamakon tsoma bakin manyan kasashen duniya, makwadaita da kuma wuce gona da iri na ma'abota girman kan duniya tsawon karnoni.

Insight can provide you with light in a dark place.,"A wani fage da ke cike da duhu, basira lamari ne da ke nuna wa mutum hanya."
The arrest of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) resulted in such an uprising in Tehran and certain other parts of the country that the regime had to step in to suppress the people in a brutal way.

"Performing daily prayers in an attentive manner - that is to say, paying attention to the fact that we are speaking to God - is a good start. The same is true about performing one's daily prayers on time. The same is true about congregational prayers and nawafil [prayers which are not obligatory].","Salla dai abu ne mai kyau; tattaro zuciya waje guda a yayin salla - wato fahimtar cewa muna magana ne da wani, akwai wani da muke magana da shi - lalle hakan mafari ne mai kyau; haka shi ma yin salla a farkon lokaci yake; salla cikin jam'i ma haka take; nafiloli ma haka suke; mutum yana iya duba irin wadannan jerin abubuwa cikin rayuwarsa."
The next requirement is that the country should not be distracted by side issues. Most of the time there is a central issue in the country which should be the focus of everybody's efforts.,"Wani sharadin na gaba shi ne rashin nuna damuwa da ababe na bayan fage.

"Because our past experiences show that in the logic of the American gentlemen, negotiation does not mean sitting down together to try to reach a rational solution. This is not what they mean by negotiation.","Don kuwa kwarewar da muke da ita tana nuni da cewa tattaunawa a mahangar Amurka ba ita ce mu zauna don mu gano hanya da mafitar da ta dace da hankali, to wannan ba shi ne abin da suke nufi da tattaunawa ba."

This is not to say that you should pretend your responsibility is easy.,"Ba wai kada ku ce akwai wahalhalu ba, saboda me, akwai wahalhalu; to amma kada ku ji tsoron wadannan wahalhalu."

"First, the essence of this astonishing and important event and this holy statement - ""Whomsoever's Moula [leader] I am, Ali is also his Moula"" - is not something that has been narrated by Shia only.

"Every day we repeatedly ask God to ""guide us to the straight path"" [the Holy Quran, 1: 6], and this shows that every minute a path branches off from the straight path we are treading - assuming that we have identified the straight path and that we are following this path.","Abin da ya zo cikin Suratul Hamd mai albarka, wanda a kowace rana mu ke karanta ta na cewa: ""Ka shiryar dam u ga hanya madaidaiciya"" (Suratul Hamd 1:6) lamari ne da ke nuni da cewa madaidaiciyar hanyar da muka rika - a matsayin misali idan har mun fahimci hakan - to a kowane lokaci muna iya isa ga wannan mararrabar (hanyoyi biyu)."

"Dear people, dear brothers, my dear children, dear youth, dear male and female seminarians, if you want to imbue the atmosphere with our scent like a flower, if you want spirituality to freely flow out of you like a river to quench the thirst of those who are after spirituality, this is how you should do it: educate yourselves before educating others.","Ya ku matasa!

It behooves the International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament to investigate the threats posed by the production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons in the world and propose realistic solutions to counter this threat to humanity.

"As for economic matters, the principles of Imam (r.a.) require relying on the national economy, relying on self-sufficiency, ensuring economic justice in production and distribution, defending underprivileged people and confronting the capitalist culture coupled with respect for ownership rights.

"Today there are so many divine signs that faith has become easier because one can see the same thing that Prophet Ibrahim saw. ""That my heart may be at ease."" [The Holy Quran, 2: 260] One can easily develop this confidence.","A yau, wato a wannan zamani da muke ciki, zamanin da ni da ku din nan muke rayuwa a ciki, akwai ayoyi da bisharori na Ubangiji da yawan gaske wadanda suke saukaka wa zuciyar mutum amincewa; don kuwa suna ganin abin nan da Annabi Ibrahim (a.s) ya fadi inda ya ke cewa: ""amma domin zuciyata, ta natsu"" (Suratul Bakara 2:260), mutum ya kan sami wannan nitsuwar."

"Life is full of twists and turns, full of ups and downs.

It is not possible to achieve one's goal as long as one does not move forward.,"Idan dai aka tsaya waje guda, to kuwa ba za a iya isa ga manufa ba."
This is not to say they only killed people.

The second thing that is represented by the 13th of Aban is the resonant yell of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.).,"Lamari na biyu wanda ake ganinsa a matsayin abin da ranar sha uku ga watan Aban ta bayyanar da shi, shi ne nuna rashin amincewar da Imamin mu mai girma ya yi."

It is necessary to preserve the dignity of people. I was asked to express my opinion regarding the extent to which the policies specified in Article 44 of the Constitution have been implemented.,"Dangane da batun gudanar da siyasar doka ta 44 (dangane da shigo da ‘yan kasuwa cikin harkokin tattalin arzikin kasa), an tambaye ni kan mene ne ra'ayina kan hakan, shin an gudanar da ita ko kuma a'a?"
"In the past thirty-something years, the individuals who have assumed power in our country and taken control of our policies and economy, have been representatives of the people.","Tsawon wadannan shekaru talatin da wani abin, masu mulkin kasar nan da kuma gudanar da lamurran tattalin arziki da siyasa na kasar nan, wakilai ne na al'umma."
"This was the situation of the economic sector in the year 1390, a year in which the enemies and ill-wishers of the Iranian nation were constantly trying to intimidate us. Sometimes they made threats. Other times they mounted political pressure on us.","Wannan bangaren tattalin arziki kenan a shekarar 1390; shekarar da tun daga farkonta zuwa karshenta makiya suka ta tada jijiyoyin wuya; a wasu lokutan suna barazana, a wasu lokutan suna yin matsin lamba na siyasa, a wasu lokutan kuma suna sanya mana takunkumi."

"By Allah's favor, such discussions, which should undoubtedly continue and result in a conscious determination and sincere effort in the global community, will be an essential step towards curbing terrorism and saving humanity from this agonizing phenomenon.","Wannan bincike da bahasi wanda ko shakka babu wajibi ne ya ci gaba sannan kuma a isar da shi cikin gaskiya da rikon amana ga dukkanin al'ummomin duniya, da yardar Allah zai iya zama wani mataki na asasi na kawar da ta'addanci da 'yantar da bil'adama daga wannan annoba mai cutarwa."
"When one understands the meaning of the 13th of Aban, one realizes who and what these people - namely, the people who were trying to smear the 13th of Aban - were and what their goal was.","A lokacin da mutum ya fahimci ma'anar sha uku ga watan Aban, to a nan ne mutum zai iya fahimtar mutanen da a tunaninsu suke son lalata wannan rana ta sha uku ga watan Aban, sannan kuma mece ce manufarsu."

"The next point is that by Allah's favor and grace, no one will be allowed to take advantage of this document in any way and to undermine the fundamental principles of the Islamic Republic whether this document is ratified or not.","Batu na gaba shi ne cewa ko an amince da wannan matanin ko ba a amince da shi ba, da yardar Allah ba za a taba barin wasu su yi mummunan amfani da hakan ba.

"But what is not so clear to many people is the role of obscure and humble people who acted as backup for the soldiers fighting at the front lines all those years - women who used to help from homes, businessmen who used to work at the bazaar, people who were active in bureaucratic organizations and jihadists who used to provide different kinds of services for the war fronts.","Abin da ya buya ga da dama daga cikin mutane shi ne gagarumar gudummawar da wadansu mutane wadanda ba a sansu ba suka bayar tsawon wadannan shekaru a fagen ba da kariya; wato matan da suke cikin gida, ‘yan kasuwan da suke cikin kasuwa, mutanen da suka kasance a ma'aikatu na gwamnati suna ci gaba da gudanar da ayyukansu, masu jihadin da suke yin hidima daban-daban ga wadansu suke fagen daga."

May Allah the Exalted associate the immaculate soul of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) - who opened up this path for our nation - with the holy souls of His saints.

"In more than a century of following the culture and politics of the arrogant powers, Muslim countries suffered from deadly calamities such as political dependence and humiliation, economic plights and poverty, decline of moral virtues and ethics and shameful scientific backwardness, and this was while the Islamic Ummah enjoyed a glorious history in all of these areas.","Sama da karni guda kenan kasashen musulmi suke fuskantar bala'oi masu halakarwa irin su dogaro da kaskanci na siyasa, talauci da rashi na tattalin arziki, munanan halaye da dabi'u, koma baya a fagen ilimi sakamakon biyayya da kuma koyi da al'adu da siyasar gwamnatocin girman kai na duniya, alhali kuwa al'ummar musulmi sun kasance masu gagarumin ci gaba abin alfahari a dukkanin wadannan fagagen."

Those who promote the idea that Islam believes in pluralism because it has praised Hazrat Moses and Hazrat Jesus should refer to the Holy Quran and Islamic texts.
